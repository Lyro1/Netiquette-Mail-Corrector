# Netiquette-Mail-Corrector
This website allows you to verify that your mail is compliant with the ACU's Netiquette. It is not associated in any way with the ACU's team, EPITA or any official administration. It is based on the rules provided in the Netiquette file from the ACU 2019 team.

Here is the website url: https://lyro1.github.io/Netiquette-Mail-Corrector/

## Features

Currently, the website checks:
- Syntax and presence of tags
- No line below 60 characters
- No line above 72 characters
- No extra blank lines
- Syntax and presence of signature

## Precisions

Since the website does not send the mail directly, you are able to copy-paste a good formated mail content and subject to your favourite mailing software. However, please note that the prerequisite for your mail to be valid is to modify the ```Content-Type``` to ```text/plain```. Browse on your the web to find how to do that with your software.

## Contribute
